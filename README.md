## Welcome to Introduction to UNIX 

  Today I am going to tell you some basic things about UNIX operating system whatever I learned from a short tutorial on introduction to UNIX for beginners.
  
  UNIX is an operating system which was first developed in the 1960s, and has been under constant development ever since. By operating system, we mean the suite of programs which make the computer work. It is a stable, multi-user, multi-tasking system for servers, desktops and laptops. 
  
  UNIX also has graphical user interface like microsoft windows but we should have knowledge of UNIX commands to carried out the operations which can not be done by graphical programs or when the there is no graphical interactions like telnet session.

# Types of UNIX :
  There are so many distros of UNIX are avaible. The most popular varieties of UNIX are Sun Solaris, GNU/Linux, and MacOS X.
