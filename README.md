## Welcome to Introduction to UNIX 

  Today I am going to tell you some basic things about UNIX operating system whatever I learned from a short tutorial on introduction to UNIX for beginners.
  
  UNIX is an operating system which was first developed in the 1960s, and has been under constant development ever since. By operating system, we mean the suite of programs which make the computer work. It is a stable, multi-user, multi-tasking system for servers, desktops and laptops. 
  
  UNIX also has graphical user interface like microsoft windows but we should have knowledge of UNIX commands to carried out the operations which can not be done by graphical programs or when the there is no graphical interactions like telnet session.

# Types of UNIX :
  There are so many distros of UNIX are avaible. The most popular varieties of UNIX are Sun Solaris, GNU/Linux, and MacOS X. 

# UNIX OS:
  UNIX is made up of shell,kernel and programs.
  
  **Kernel**:- It is called as heart of the operating systems. It allocates time and memory for the processes.
  **Shell**:-  It is the interface between the kernel and user. It takes the commands from the user, interpretes them and give it to the kernel for the execution.
  
  In UNIX everything is considered as either file or process.
  Process means the program in the running state.
  File is the collection of the data.
  There are two types of file as normal file and directories.
  
  All the files are grouped together in the directory structure. The file-system is arranged in a hierarchical structure, like an inverted tree. The top of the hierarchy is traditionally called root (written as a slash / ).
  
  There teminal in UNIX operating system where we can run our commands.
  
## Basic UNIX Commands in Short
  **ls**:-
    This command is used for display the name of all files and folders from the specified directory.
